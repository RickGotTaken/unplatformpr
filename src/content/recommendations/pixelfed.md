The closest thing to "good Instagram" that you'll find on the internet. Pixelfed is federated - meaning that you can either join the main Pixelfed "server" and hang out with everyone else, or you can create your own server (i.e. like an exclusive Instagram) for your friend group or organization. They've recently released a mobile app, too.
