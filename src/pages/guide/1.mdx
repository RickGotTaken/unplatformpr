Before we begin in earnest, I want to set expectations.

## >: Curation Takes More Effort Than Algorithms

A common theme you'll see throughout the recommendations in this guide is that “inconvenience is good.” Replacing the <Buzzword definition="Content feeds generated by machine learning algorithms (e.g. TikTok's For You page, X's Home Feed, etc.) instead of manual curation.">algorithmic feeds</Buzzword> you currently use with <Buzzword definition="Content feeds created by manually and intentionally subscribing to different people, publications, and websites.">curated feeds</Buzzword> is going to take some time, but the content feeds you have at the end of the process are going to be truly and entirely *yours*, and you won't have to worry anymore about getting a truckload of targeted advertising because you happened to watch one Reel for 1.523 more seconds than the last one.

## >: You Will Have Less Content

The reason Web 2.0 platforms made a nearly universal shift toward algorithmic feeds throughout the 2010s is because they can give you a virtually infinite amount of content from across the entire platform. In contrast, curated feeds are going to be limited by nature - your favorite bloggers, artists, and podcasters aren't going to be able to produce an infinite number of posts.

***This is a feature, not a bug.***

[“Doomscrolling”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) only exists as a phenomenon because the Web 2.0 platforms are specifically engineered to keep your eyes glued to the screen as much as possible. If you successfully complete the process laid out by this guide and replace your algorithmic feeds with curated ones, you will find that on most days you'll wake up, start reading or otherwise consuming the content in your feeds, and then you'll get to the end. At that point, you'll be able to do something amazing: literally anything else.

Again, *this is a good thing* — and if you find yourself wanting more to read and watch, the people and publications you've subscribed to will almost certainly have recommendations for other things to read and watch, and before you know it, you'll have an enormous curated collection of artists, writers, and educators that you can share with others. More importantly, that collection will have been curated entirely by *you*, and not by anybody's algorithm.

## >: You Will Have To Learn (Some) Things About Technology

I've done my best to make this guide accessible to virtually anyone with the technical expertise to open a web browser, but the simple fact is that social media became popular because it was explicitly built to lower the technical barrier to entry for self-expression on the Internet.

For better, and mostly for worse, social media still does this. None of the solutions I will offer will be more convenient than downloading X or Instagram, creating an account, and posting away. It is critical that you understand that the price of that convenience is both control over your digital identity, and the products of your digital labor. To be a user of these platforms is to be a [digital sharecropper](https://www.roughtype.com/?p=634), creating content and viewing ads for the direct financial benefit of the richest and most powerful people in the world — in the hope that they occasionally toss you a few scraps in the form of exposure or information.

Not only that, but your status as a digital sharecropper indirectly undermines the efforts of everyone else who isn't, as your presence on these platforms puts social pressure on everyone else to stay so they can have access to the largest pool of eyes. Even worse, this pressure is most effective and damaging on the people you care the most about: your friends, family, and — if you're a professional creative — your fans.

*That* is the price of convenience — of never taking the time to set up an RSS reader, or write a few lines of HTML, or actually surf the web to find the content you want to see. I'm sure you can understand why that isn't a worthwhile trade.

## >: There Will Still Be People Who Suck Shit
…but they won't be algorithmically incentivized to suck shit.

So much of the social dysfunction of Web 2.0 is driven by the way that the platforms reward “engagement,” which in turn rewards rage bait. They want you to be furious at that stupid post that came on your timeline so that you spend the next hour brawling in the replies — for them, each meaningless battle or “discourse” flash point is more eyeballs on the screen, which in turn means more advertising dollars for them.

After you complete this guide and begin exploring the indie web, it's only a matter of time before you encounter somebody who you think is stupid, bigoted, or otherwise toxic. Here's the beauty of it, though — you can simply not put their URL in your address bar. Trolls can't force their way into your RSS feed, and leaving a toxic forum community doesn't demand you burn all your email contacts. Once your digital social life is no longer controlled by the whims of the tech oligarchs, you will — now and forever — have the power to simply walk away. Nobody will ever be able to lock you in a “walled garden” ever again.  

## >: You Will Not Have As Much “Exposure”
This section is particularly important for online creators. The unfortunate reality is that if you get a large portion of your business revenue directly or indirectly from social media, this guide probably is not going to get you to the point where you can comfortably press “delete account.” However, it will get you to a point where you'll be ready to press “delete account” when the time comes. And make no mistake — **the time *will* come**.

For example, if you're an artist of any kind on Instagram right now, you're indirectly lining the pockets of a company that has [openly signaled its interest in replacing you and your fans with robots](https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/). If you're on X, [you're jostling for attention with the same kind of machine-generated slop](https://www.404media.co/hollywood-sign-burning-ai-images-la-wildfire/). This is just the beginning - it will not get better. You will never be able to out-compete AI slop vendors on volume in the long term, and even if you do, your reward will be having to share space with industrialized misinformation and hate speech. 

Joining the indie web — making a newsletter, distributing your work through RSS, and having a personal website instead of (or in addition to) an Instagram account — will take work, and it will not expose you to the staggering numbers of people that social media promises you. With that said, it will mean that the people who find your work will be much more likely to actually care about it, because they'll be encountering it through trusted recommendations or intentional exploration. That's in sharp contrast of how people encounter your work on social media: as one small part of a giant fire hose of content, folded in among thirst traps and AI-generated atrocities.

If you haven't been scared off by everything I just told you, then we're finally ready to get started. I'm proud you made it this far.
