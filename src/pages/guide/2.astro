<Guide frontmatter={{ title: "Where are you at?" }}>
	<p>
		Before we continue, I'm going to need an idea of how familiar you are
		with digital technology. My recommendations will vary quite wildly
		depending on your level of tech literacy, and I want to make sure I'm
		not tossing anything at you that you're not ready for. Select the level
		of tech literacy that best applies to you:
	</p>
	<TechLiteracySelector client:only className="mb-4">
		<div slot="fallback" class="flex justify-center items-center h-48">
			<LoadingIndicator />
		</div>
	</TechLiteracySelector>
	<p>
		After that, I need to know some specifics about what you use social
		media for:
	</p>
	<UseCaseSelector client:only className="mb-4">
		<div slot="fallback" class="flex justify-center items-center h-24">
			<LoadingIndicator />
		</div>
	</UseCaseSelector>
	<p>
		These answers will be saved in your web browser to decide what parts of
		the guide to show you and what order to show you them in. If you want to
		change your answers later, you can do so by coming back to this part of
		the guide.
	</p>
	<p>
		After you've answered those questions, we can move on to talking about
		<i>the technology</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		(P.S. if there's a specific use case you have for social media that
		wasn't covered here, *please* let me know about it by shooting an email
		to <a href="mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com">
		unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com.</a>)
	</p>
