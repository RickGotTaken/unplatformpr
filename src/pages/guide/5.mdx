When doing initial interviews with Web 2.0 users during the development of Unplatform, one of the most powerful forces keeping folks on conventional social media was a need to keep up with local events. The only way to address that need in particular is would be to create an enormous database of RSS feeds and newsletters for artists, organizations, and venues from every city in the world... so that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

It probably goes without saying, but this part of the guide is going to remain a living document. I cannot collect every newsletter and RSS feed from every city on Earth on my own. I've tried my best to sniff out the ones relevant to the largest metropolitan areas in North America (where I live), but it's still going to be pretty incomplete. **If your city isn't listed below, or if you know of a newsletter / RSS feed that I missed, *please* [let me know](mailto:unplatform@fromthesuperhighway.com).**

> <Icon name="feather:alert-circle" class={"inline"} /> This list is grouped by metropolitan area, not by exact city boundaries. If your city doesn't show up here, try selecting the largest city near you.

<DatabaseView client:load title={"Local Events & Feeds"} className="mb-4" hideOptions={{os: true, maxComplexity: true}} categoryConstraints={["all", "events", "magazine", "forum", "blog", "organization", "news"]} localOnly/>

Once you're ready, we can continue.
