For many folks, being a <Buzzword definition="Someone who primarily views content of an online community without posting much themselves.">lurker</Buzzword> is all they're trying to get out of their digital life - and that's totally fine. But if you're someone who wants to use the web as a way to express yourself, I've got great news: this is one place where the indie web completely blows social media out of the water.

The most important vehicle for your self-expression on the indie web is your personal website. Don't worry - you won't need to write even a single line of code if you don't want to (but if you're willing to try, the options available to you are far greater). I've collected a list of website builders, blogging services, and alternative social platforms that let you carve out a customizable space for yourself online - and many of them can get you up and running in literally minutes.

<DatabaseView title={"Site Builders"} className="mb-4" hideOptions={{category: true, os: true, city: true}} defaultOptions={{category: "site builder"}}/>

Feel free to take the time to setup your space, but don't get too obsessed with making it perfect just yet - we're almost at the end of the guide.
