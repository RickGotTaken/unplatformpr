An extremely common use case for social media is keeping up with news and politics. This is bad, because social media is a uniquely horrible place to keep up with news and politics - The signal-to-noise ratio is simply far too lopsided in favor of noise. Be honest with yourself. Are you independently vetting every infographic you're signal boosting? Do you fact-check every community note? Do you fully read every article whose headline you retweet?

Maybe your brain is enormous and you're an infallible arbiter of truth - more power to you, if that's the case. You're *probably* not, though, and the folks who you're following probably aren't either, and the folks that *they're* following probably aren't, and so on - and that's isn't anybody's fault. (Well, it is *somebody's* fault, but not yours.) It's a simple fact that an organization full of professional writers and journalists is going to be better at sorting the wheat from the chaff than a bunch of decentralized individuals "signal boosting" each other within a digital ecosystem that's filled to the brim with heretofore unimaginable amounts of misinformation.

That isn't to say you start blindly believing the narratives peddled by mainstream media organizations (that is its own can of worms that's outside the scope of this guide), but it *is* to say that the level of effort required to write and publish an actual report or article will, in general, raise the quality and veracity of the information being presented. Additionally, precisely because reports and articles take more effort than infographics and captions, they're much more likely to be presenting information or ideas that are actually worth your time. I've collected a list of online newspapers, magazines, and journals with active newsletters and RSS feeds below:
