When it comes to news, the effort required to actually write a full article instead of make a social media post will, in general, raise the quality and veracity of the information being presented. Additionally, precisely because reports and articles take more effort than infographics and captions, they're much more likely to be presenting information or ideas that are actually worth your time. I've collected a list of online newspapers, magazines, and journals with active newsletters and RSS feeds below: 

<DatabaseView title={"News, Politics, and Magazines"} className="mb-4" hideOptions={{category: true, maxComplexity: true, os: true}} categoryConstraints={["all", "news", "magazine"]}/>

Once you've subscribed to the ones you're interested in, we can finally move to the conclusion!
